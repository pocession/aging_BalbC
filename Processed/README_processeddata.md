# Processed data
The repository hosts processed data, including methylation counts, transcript counts and microbe counts (Not processed yet).

## RNAseq
Host all transcript counts, as shown in length-adjusted transcripts per million (TPM). Obtain the counts in './Processed/RNAseq/{SampleID}/quant.sf'.

## RRBS
Host all methylation counts (only CpG), processed by bismark. Obtain small intestine samples in [cpg_2018](./Processed/RRBS/cpg_2018/) and obtain large intestine samples in [cpg_2022](./Processed/RRBS/cpg_2022/).

## microbe
Host 16S rRNA counts from microbes, as shown in operational taxonomy unit (OTU). Not processed yet.
